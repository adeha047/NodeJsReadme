# README GENERATOR

  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## Description 

I wanted to use this activity to determine how to create a well structured README through node.js. 
I used the switch function to display the badge at the top of the screen.
I used the switch fuction to display the license as well when the user selected this from the list of options.  
I used the inquirer package to capture user input. 
I stored this information in the README File using a built "fs" pacakage for node.
